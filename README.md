# Linear-Algebra-Calculator
Basic calculator for fundamental Matrix and Vector operations in Python.

To use this calculator, you should have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, you can install the necessary NumPy library using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

Vector Operations:

- [x] **Addition:** Element-wise addition of two vectors of the same dimension.
- [x] **Subtraction:** Element-wise subtraction of one vector from another of the same dimension.
- [x] **Scalar Multiplication:** Multiplication of each element of a vector by a scalar value.
- [x] **Magnitude:** The length or Euclidean norm of the vector.
- [x] **Dot/Scalar Product:** The scalar result of the sum of the products of corresponding elements of two vectors of the same dimension.
- [x] **Cross/Vector Product:** A vector perpendicular to two 3-dimensional input vectors.

Matrix Operations:

- [x] **Addition**
- [x] **Subtraction**
- [x] **Scalar Multiplication**
- [x] **Multiplication**
- [x] **Determinant**
- [x] **Transposition**
- [x] **Cofactor**
- [x] **Adjugate**
- [x] **Inverse**

**Future Enhancements:**

* Potentially adding more advanced linear algebra functions.
* Development of a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
